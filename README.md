# AnalysisComplexityOfLists
In this practical we were asked to run experiments to test the time the standard quicksort algorithm can sort lists of varying degrees of sortedness. We were to find different ways to measure sortedness and how changing the measure of sortedness of a list alters the amount of time taken to completely sort the list.
